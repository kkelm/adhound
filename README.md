AdHound™ empowers media distribution professionals with the most powerful and customizable advertisement placement tracking system on the market. Offering you and your clients accurate performance and accounting reports.

Forged by a talented team and extensive research of the media distribution industry AdHound™ converts the complexities of media distribution tracking into a powerful yet easy to use tool.
