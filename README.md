AdHound™ empowers media distribution professionals with the most powerful and customizable advertisement placement tracking system on the market. Offering you and your clients accurate performance and accounting reports.

Forged by a talented team and extensive research of the media distribution industry AdHound™ converts the complexities of media distribution tracking into a powerful yet easy to use tool.

The team at AdHound™ recognizes that media distribution isn't a one person job. So the team has integrated the ability for media distribution professionals to assign multiple users/assistants under their account, and assign those users with specific viewing and editing privileges.
