## Problem Statement
I was approach a couple years ago by an employee of a company that distributes ads throughout the great Rochester, MN area because he wasn't happy with the ad tracking software his company was using. The software is a desktop application with no web interface and no mobile capabilities. It does connect to a remote database which allows area managers view the performance of each of their distributors. The issues the employee was having were with the UI, and lack of features to make his job easier.
